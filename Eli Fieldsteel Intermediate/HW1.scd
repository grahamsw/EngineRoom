There are very few restrictions or guidelines beyond this! Simply:

1. You can copy code from the livestream code files, but add some changes and developments of your own, or even better, code your SynthDefs from scratch as a good learning exercise.

2. You can start using unorganized, piecemeal code sketches, but in the end you should format your code using the performance structure from HW 0 (or something similar) so that everything can be setup with one keystroke, with a separate chunk of code below that for performing the piece. I'm flexible on this â€” I just want it to be easy for me to run your pieces!

3. Make it sound awesome!

When finished, title your scd file "LastName_HW1.scd" and upload it to the course website.
